> *I started with CSS during the Responsive revolution, moved to React just when it dropped, and now design evolvable domain-driven systems. As a Tech Lead, I specialise in education, co√∂rdination, and assuring system coherence through communication. I also organise several meetups: I co-founded [Frontendisti.cz](https://frontendisti.cz/) and run [React Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/react-berlin-meetup/).*
